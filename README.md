Explore memory. Find out the number of bytes that C uses on your system to store the various types described below. 
Hint: You can use sizeof() function to print the number of bytes that given type uses(e.g printf("%lu\n", sizeof(int)) char, int, unsigned int, long long, unsigned long long, float, double 
Are types signed or unsigned by default? 
What are the maximum and minimum values you can store in each of the types? 
What happens if you add 1 to the maximum value of a type, what happens if you subtract 1 from the minimum value of the type?
